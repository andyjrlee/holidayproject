# holidayproject

Why are we doing this? 
To test how as learners we have progressed and understood the first 7 week of the training

How I expected the challenge to go. 
its going to be a tough task, and remembering how to link everything together is going to be a challange.

What went well? 

What didn't go as planned? 

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
