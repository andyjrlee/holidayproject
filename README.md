# holidayproject

Why are we doing this? 
To test how as learners we have progressed and understood the first 7 week of the training

How I expected the challenge to go. 
its going to be a tough task, and remembering how to link everything together is going to be a challange.

What went well? 
initial set up of DB schema and set up of front end went as planned, as i was unable to get the fetch to work, i opted to test all my CRUD code and schemas via postman which was successful, and it was a positive to see CRUD in action with my own code.

What didn't go as planned? 
I came up against a CORS policy issude with chrome (also tested in edge and same issue), spent hours trawling stack overflow, W3school, mozilla developer and unable to fix issue, ended up asking Ed Reynolds for support and his recommendation (adding @CrossOrigin to my controller) fixed everything, frustrating that it was such a simple fix and wasnt able to find it in all the materials i had spent hours reading through. 
On the back of getting my fetch to work i was then able to successfully view the data on the web page which feel liks a big win for now.


Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
